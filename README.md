# Scalable ArduinoUno/Dragino LoRa Sensor Network
# Without LoRaWAN or Third-Party Services

Many applications, including precision agriculture and precision irrigation, require remote-sensing of data generated by various pieces of equipment. This page provides the currently-existing code and documentation for a prototype for using LoRa point-to-point radio broadcasts to link remote data to where it is needed. We avoid the use of third-party services and LoRaWAN. Soil-moisture is the original application but the approach is general enough that other sensors could be employed. An example is multi-value sensors such as cameras. Open-Access software, hardware, and programming tools are used as much as possible. The basestation can be hosted locally, with no network employed, or remotely, via the internet or a local network. Windows or Linux works well as a basestation OS. Other hardware involves Arduino, Raspberry, and Dragino equipment.

At issue with all forms of radio broadcast are inhibitions to the propagation of the transmitterâ€™s radio broadcasts. For instance, there may be a hill between the transmitter and the receiver. As the number of sensors expands and the number of propagation inhibitors increases, a network of transceivers needs to be formed. This enhances the scalability of the overall system. That is the general purpose of LoRaWAN but that approach can be expensive and complicated. Third-party services are also avoided because of their continuing costs and proprietary nature. Our approach uses simple and relatively inexpensive point-to-point LoRa transceivers plugged into a microcontroller board.

At present, this project uses ArduinoUnoR3/Dragino microcontroller/transceiver units to build a network of transceiver/sensing units in such a way that the overall system is scalable but without using complex and expensive LoRaWAN or proprietary continuous-fee third-party services. In a sense, hardware is replaced by software. To be sure, the formal LoRaWAN standard has not been implemented. However, many of its attributes are present.

* LoRaFloodMessaging: Software and background for the LoRa Flood Messaging proof of concept.

* CaptureCameraFrames_Uploaded: Demonstration of Arduino Potenta H7 microcontroller board coupled with Vision Shield - LoRa to capture, send via USB/Serial, and display the camera's image on a PC. This is part of a learning process aimed at eventual LoRa broadcast of images.

* CaptureAndSendFrames_Uploaded: Functionally similar to CaptureCameraFrames_Uploaded but uses LoRa-sized messages that contain a CRC check value.

* Programmable_USB_Hub: The H7 device did not work out for this effort since its camera is only grayscale and it will not do LoRa point-to-point, as far as I can determine. This code demonstrates the basic idea of linking two Arduino Uno microcontrollers via a programmable USB hub.

* Pixy-ImageSegmentation: Demonstrates a microcontroller/camera unit sending LoRa-sized image segments to a PC. The segments are reconstructed and displayed. LoRa itself is not yet engaged.
