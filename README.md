# Scalable ArduinoUno/Dragino LoRa Sensor Network
# - Without LoRaWAN

In an earlier effort, https://github.com/SoothingMist/Remote-Soil-Moisture-Sensing, a prototype for using LoRa radio broadcasts to remotely monitor sensors was demonstrated. Soil-moisture is the application but the approach is general enough that other sensors could be employed. Open-Access software and programming tools were used exclusively. Open-Access hardware was employed as much as possible. The basestation can be hosted locally, with no network employed, or remotely, via the internet or a local network.

At issue with the earlier effort is that it works well in situations where there are no inhibitions to the propagation of the transmitterâ€™s radio broadcasts. For instance, there may be a hill between the transmitter and the receiver. As the number of sensors expands and the number of propagation inhibitors increases, a network of transceivers would need to be formed. This would enhance the scalability of the overall system.

This present project uses ArduinoUno/Dragino microcontroller/transceiver units from the earlier effort to build a network of transceiver/sensing units in such a way that the overall system is scalable but without using complex and expensive LoRaWAN. In a sense, hardware is replaced by software. To be sure, the formal LoRaWAN standard has not been implemented. However, many of its attributes are present.

A full paper has been submitted for publication in the peer-reviewed literature on the LoRa flood-messaging proof of concept.

* EncryptDecrypt: Demonstrates how to add AES encryption/decryption to ArduinoUno/Dragino microcontroller/transceiver units.

* Uno-On-off: Demonstrates Arduino's external on/off timer as a means of saving battery charge.

* LoRaFloodMessaging: Software and background for the LoRa Flood Messaging proof of concept.

* CaptureCameraFrames_Uploaded: Demonstration of Arduino Potenta H7 microcontroller board coupled with Vision Shield - LoRa to capture, send via USB/Serial, and display the camera's image on a PC. This is part of a learning process aimed at eventual LoRa broadcast of images.

* CaptureAndSendFrames_Uploaded: Functionally similar to CaptureCameraFrames_Uploaded but uses LoRa-sized messages that contain a CRC check value.

* Programmable_USB_Hub: The H7 device did not work out for this effort since its camera is only grayscale and it will not do LoRa point-to-point, as far as I can determine. Going to try linking two Arduino Uno microcontrollers via a programmable USB hub. This code demonstrates the basic concept.
